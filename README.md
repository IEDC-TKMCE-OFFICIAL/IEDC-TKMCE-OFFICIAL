The Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Center of TKMCE is an organisation that aims to promote the institutional vision of transforming youngsters into technological entrepreneurs and innovative leaders. The initiative is to address the rising trend of corporate job culture and establish a platform to pursue ideas and businesses at an early stage.

We at IEDC TKMCE host various workshops, speaker sessions, competitions to develop skill sets and provide essential resources to take up entrepreneurship as a career.
